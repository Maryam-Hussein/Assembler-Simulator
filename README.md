## 📖 Project Overview

This project is a functional implementation of the initial phases of a **Assembler Simulator**: the **Lexical Analyzer** (Scanner) and the **Syntax Analyzer** (Parser). It was developed to simulate how high-level language code is transformed into machine-readable formats by checking for grammatical correctness and valid token sequences.

[cite_start]The system takes source code as input, tokenizes it, and then validates the structure using an **LL(1) Top-Down Parsing algorithm**[cite: 648].

**Academic Context:**
* **Institution:** Pharos University in Alexandria (PUA).
* **Faculty:** Faculty of Engineering.
* **Department:** Computer Engineering Department.
* **Course:** Programming Languages & Translators.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Lexical Analysis (The Scanner)
The first phase of the compiler reads the source code (character stream) and converts it into a sequence of meaningful **Tokens**.
* **Token Recognition:** Identifies specific language elements including:
    * **Keywords:** `int`, `char`, `main`, `switch`, `case`, `printf`.
    * **Operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `=`.
    * **Delimiters:** `{`, `}`, `(`, `)`, `;`.
    * **Identifiers:** Variable names (e.g., `x`, `y`, `sol`).
* **Output:** Generates a list of tokens classified by their type (e.g., `integer`, `Keywords`, `Delimiter`).

### 2. Syntax Analysis (The Parser)
The second phase verifies if the sequence of tokens forms a valid expression based on the language's grammar.
* **LL(1) Algorithm:** Implements a Top-Down parsing method using a Stack and a Parsing Table.
* **Parse Table:** Utilizes a 2D array matrix to define grammar rules and production checks.
* **Validation:**
    * **Accepted:** If the stack is empty and the input string is fully traversed (reaches `$`).
    * **Rejected:** Displays error messages if the token sequence violates the grammar rules.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Programming Language:** Java.
* **Core Logic:** Stack Data Structure (`java.util.Stack`) for parsing and `ArrayList` for token management.
* **I/O:** `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter` for reading source files and writing outputs.

### 🧠 Core Logic & Algorithms

#### Lexical Logic
The scanner reads the file line-by-line and splits the text using whitespace delimiters. It compares each extracted word against pre-defined lists of **Keywords**, **Operators**, and **Delimiters**. If no match is found among these categories, the scanner treats the word as an **Identifier**.

#### LL(1) Parsing Logic
* **Initialization:** The stack is initialized by pushing the Start Symbol (e.g., `E`), and the input string is appended with the `$` character to mark the end of the stream.
* **Iteration:** The parser continuously compares the **Top of the Stack** with the **Current Input Token**:
    * **If Top is Non-Terminal:** It looks up the corresponding production rule in the Parsing Table (`table[][]`) and pushes the rule onto the stack in **reverse order**.
    * **If Top is Terminal:** It checks for a match with the current input token.
        * *Match:* It advances to the next token.
        * *Mismatch:* It reports a syntax error.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
* An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, or a simple command-line interface.

### Installation & Execution
1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Maryam-Hussein/Assembler-Simulator.git](https://github.com/Maryam-Hussein/Assembler-Simulator.git)
    ```
2.  **Prepare Source File:**
    * Ensure `Source program.txt` exists in the directory. This file contains the code you want to compile.
3.  **Run the Application:**
    * Compile and run `Main.java`.
    * The program will first execute the **Lexical Analysis**, identifying words and generating `Syntax.txt`.
    * It will then trigger the **LL(1) Parser** to validate the syntax.
